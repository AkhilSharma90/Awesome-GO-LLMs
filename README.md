## Model APIs and Wrappers  
- **[Vertex AI Go Client](https://pkg.go.dev/cloud.google.com/go/aiplatform)**  
  A Go client for interacting with Googleâ€™s Vertex AI, which provides LLMs for text, code, and chat applications.  

- **[Replicate Go](https://github.com/replicate/replicate-go)**  
  A Go client for Replicate's API, enabling interaction with hosted models like LLaMA and Stable Diffusion.  

- **[BERT-Go](https://github.com/nlpodyssey/spago)**  
  A library for working with transformer models like BERT. While focused on NLP tasks, it supports building applications that leverage transformer-based embeddings.  

---

## Data Processing and Utilities  
- **[Go-Vectorizer](https://github.com/danieldk/go-vectorizer)**  
  A Go library for creating embeddings using pre-trained language models, making it suitable for semantic search and clustering applications.  

- **[gRPC-GPT](https://github.com/hysios/grpc-gpt)**  
  A gRPC-based API wrapper for OpenAIâ€™s GPT models. It enables scalable and efficient communication between applications and LLMs.  

- **[Go-Tokenizers](https://github.com/superior-tokenizer/go-tokenizer)**  
  A tokenizer library in Go for handling tokenization tasks with various LLMs, including support for byte-pair encoding (BPE).

## Applications  
- **[Hetty](https://github.com/dstotijn/hetty)**  
  While primarily a security research tool, Hetty incorporates HTTP interactions with intelligent processing for advanced workflows.  

- **[LLM-Repl](https://github.com/direnv/llm-repl)**  
  A command-line REPL application for querying LLMs like GPT-4. Built with Go, it is a lightweight and extensible option for developers.  

- **[LLM-Bot-Go](https://github.com/llmbot/go-llm-bot)**  
  A conversational AI chatbot framework in Go, integrating LLMs for building advanced dialog-based applications.
